# VSHELL
## vShell is a shell made by voxj., that allows you to add extensions!
<br><br>
# REQUIREMENTS
## A Linux machine will work well. I used Manjaro and it worked.
<br><br>
# HOW TO USE?
## The installation is very simple!
### 1. [get the latest release from Releases](https://github.com/voxj/vShell/releases/)
### 2. make sure you have the latest possible version of [Python](https://python.org/)
### 3. run main.py - it will get the modules automatically!
### 4. Enjoy!
## NOTE: if it doesn't work for you and you're using Windows, i have the same problem, so waiting for a pull request
